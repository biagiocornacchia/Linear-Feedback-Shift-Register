# Linear Feedback Shift Register
A VHDL specification of an LSFR used to produce a pseudo-random sequence of bits.

## Assignement
This project has been developed for the Electronics and Communication Systems course (MSc Computer Engineering) at University of Pisa. The project consists in the development of a VHDL specification and implementation on the ZyBo Board by Xilinx of a Linear Feedback Shift Register.

## Tools
